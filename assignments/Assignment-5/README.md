# Assignment-5
## Task 1
- Created a dictionary with the structure that a name has a certain value attached to it (marks)
- Then ask the user for a input for the name
- Put a conditional where if the name matches then it prints out the number from the dictionary
- If the name does not match then it simply prints out no names matched.

## Task 2
- First created a list from 1 to 10.
- Then created another list as first_five with ":5" which iterates upto index 5 but does not include it. (i.e, from 0-4 five elements)
- Then created another list as reversed_first_five with "::-1" which takes the values from first_five and reverses the order because of steps being -1
- Then print out all the lists as the result.
